# Business Case

Conduct predictive and descriptive analytics for container throughput

### Target Outcomes:
As a global terminal operator, PSA Singapore is interested to forecast the container throughput for a
more effective planning to address peak demand and minimise vessel’s waiting time to berth. A
forecast error of +/-100 containers can result in a one hour difference for a vessel’s port stay, which
can significantly impact operations. Terminal planning is complex and involves yard space to store
containers, manpower deployed for equipment such as cranes and trucks, and equipment’s
availability through maintenance planning.

The desired outcomes of the container forecasting will be as follows:

(a) aggregate weekly volume for next 2 months

(b) aggregate daily volume for next 2 weeks

(c) volume per vessel weekly scheduled to call into port

(d) Insights on operational impact related and not limited to

(i) Cyclical or seasonal patterns in 

(a) types of volume being handled for e.g. Empty
or Laden, 20’ or 40’, Reefer, Local or T/Shipment

(b) geography in terms of origin
and destination of container traffic

(ii) Economic, geo-political, business and environmental conditions that can affect
shippers, industry and the broader supply chain as a whole.
